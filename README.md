# Calabrese.kitchen

##### https://cbreezy.kitchen/ is now https://calabrese.kitchen/

Calabrese Kitchen grew out of a love for cooking that my dad instilled. Over the years I started to occaisionally write about what we were cooking, especially as I started to handle more and more it on my own. Eventually my parents moved to a gorgeous Spanish style house on a street called Calabrese, which is where I feel my cooking came into its own. 

Eventually I built a short-lived cooking blog, https://cbreezy.kitchen/, using HarpJS. Then it was rebuilt using Hugo. Then again with Gatsby. And I never actually posted there. As much as I loved cooking, and as much as I loved writing about food, posting about food seemed to have a hurdle. So I removed the barrier to entry. 

https://calabrese.kitchen/ is now `no code` using [Notion](https://notion.so) as a backend, and a Cloudflare service worker to proxy the domain (since [Notion currently does not support custom domains](https://gist.github.com/mayneyao/b9fefc9625b76f70488e5d8c2a99315d)). 

Hopefully I'll post here more. It's a lot nicer to spin up a free-form notes, over a structured article.

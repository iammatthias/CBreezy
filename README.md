## Boiler: A HarpJS Boilerplate

Boiler is a [HarpJS](http://harpjs.com) boilerplate, with partials, blog posts, and minimal CSS. It is meant to provide a basic set-up for a static HarpJS blog that can be hosted anywhere you choose(your own VPS, Amazon S3, Netlify, Surge, Github Pages, etc.) Bits of the CSS use [Colors](http://clrs.cc), and [Fluidity](http://fluidity.sexy) from [MRMRS](http://mrmrs.cc).

### Installation
```
$ sudo npm install -g harp

$ git clone https://github.com/iammatthias/Boiler.git

$ cd boiler

$ harp server
```
### Usage

HarpJS is a static web server with built-in preprocessing. It's pretty nifty. Generally when you use Harp, and first run `harp init myproject` you get this:

```
myproject/
  |- _layout.jade
  |- 404.jade
  |- index.jade
  +- main.less
```

There is nothing really wrong with that, but there is a better way. Here is what Boilerplate starts with:

```
boiler/
  |- /public
  |-- /_shared
  |--- _head.ejs
  |--- _header.ejs
  |--- _footer.ejs
  |-- /assets
  |--- /css
  |--- /js
  |-- /posts
  |-- _data.json
  |-- _layout.ejs
  |-- CNAME
  |-- 404.ejs
  |-- index.ejs
  |- .bowerrc
  |- .travis.yml
  |- harp.json
  |- package.json
  |- /readme
```

Woah. That's quite a bit different from the basic 'harp init' structure. Let's walk through it.

Everything lives in the project folder `/boiler/`. Within `/boiler/` you'll find a few extra files.
  - `.bowerrc` makes sure all your Bower components end up in /public/assets/vendor.
  - `.travis.yml` file to serve as a basic configuration for Travis CI that will build your HarpJS app/site, and deploy it to Surge. Loads Harp and Surge from the NPM dev-dependencies.
  - The CNAME file in /public tells Surge to publish to your `your-own-domain.com` instead of `your-own-domain.surge.sh`. For more information on setting up Travis CI with Surge, please check Surge's documentation: https://surge.sh/help/integrating-with-travis-ci

Deploying with Surge is really fast, and really painless. It's a pretty great service. And since this boilerplate is all simple static files, it weighs in at less than Bootstrap.

The main files you need to worry about here are `harp.json` and `package.json`.
  - `harp.json` contains all global metadata for your site.
  - `package.json` should be familiar to anyone who uses NPM.

Now onto the 'public' folder. This is where your app/site lives! There are partials in the `_shared` folder that control your sites head, header, and footer. Feel free to add your own for different content types. The `assets` folder contains your CSS and vendor files, and makes a nice home for your media assets as well. `posts` is home to any blog posts your might right.

The '_layout.ejs' file is a common template that includes all content except for one main content area. You can think of a Layout as the inverse of a partial. Often sites and apps will have common headers and footers and the only area that needs to change is the body. That is where `index.ejs` comes in! You can really put any content you want in here, but it is currently an EJS script that lists the slugs from the different blog posts.
